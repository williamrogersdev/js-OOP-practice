Exercise 4
Without editing the code you've already written, add an introduce method to the personStore object that logs "Hi, my name is [name]".

// add code here
sandra.introduce();
// -> Logs 'Hi, my name is Sandra'



Solution 4
personStore.introduce = function () {
  console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name}`);
};
